\begin{abstract}
  We propose to search for CP-violation in the charged lepton sector by studying ortho-positronium decays.
  Positronium, a bound state of an electron and positron, occurs in both a singlet and triplet state. The triplet
  state, ortho-positronium, decays primarily into three gamma rays. CP-violation could potentially manifest
  itself in angular correlations between the directions of the three photons and the spin of the ortho-positronium
  (o-Ps). We propose to use the APEX annular array of NaI detectors for gamma ray detection, combined
  with a tagged source and a novel, conventional electromagnet. APEX will increase the angular acceptance,
  hence, statistics, by a factor of 25 over previous experiments. We also implement several experimental
  improvements to reduce our systematic uncertainties compared to previous experiments. I will present
  the current status of the experiment, named CALIOPE, which stands for CP Aberrant Leptons in Ortho-
  Positronium Experiment, and our future plans.

  I would like to thank my parents, Lynn and Peter Bartram, and sister, Chloe Bartram. Additionally, I would like to thank Janice Yong, my college roommate and best friend, for her unwavering support and invaluable outsider perspective. Furthermore, I owe it to my physics friends from BU, who, even though we separated for grad school, have continued to support each other. I feel lucky to have friends who are supportive of women in science.
  This is dedicated to James F. Bartram, my grandfather and electrical engineer, and Jeremiah Lynch, my grand-uncle, an industrial hygenist. They set the bar so high both in the sciences and as kind, conscientious human beings. James with his fastidious attention to the feelings of others and Jerry with his ``Lynch conscience''. I feel so lucky to be related to men in science who were not one-dimensional and truly stellar humans. I remember as a kid being astounded by the framed equation in my grandfather's office: $e^{i\pi}=-1$! How could such a thing be true?!
  Thanks also goes out to my group members Joule Othman and my undergrads.
  Thanks to Reyco Henning, for being a good advisor.
  Finally, I would like to dedicate this to Karen Thompson, my friend and pancreatic cancer survivor for 12 years, who taught me the true meaning of gratitude, forgiveness, and how to be optimistic against all odds. You helped me re-frame my graduate school experience and gave me the strength to never give up.
