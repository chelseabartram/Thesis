\section{Geant Simulation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------%

Using Geant4 [18], we have created a replica of the APEX geometry for our simulation. Most of the code
for the detector construction was written by Stephen Daigle. Some improvements have recently been made
by an undergraduate, Chiara Salemi, who is working with our group. We have added additional components
to the simulation, specically the electromagnet and a holder containing the source and aerogel. I have
implemented one possible source holder in the simulation (Figure 11), complete with the positron source
(22Na) deposited on kapton foil and sandwiched between pieces of scintillator and aerogel. In the simulation,
as in the physical world, a positron exiting the source is tagged and then scatters within the aerogel until
it loses enough kinetic energy to form positronium. The aluminium source and all of its constituents were
incorporated into the simulation this past year.
